Welcome to the distributed-notary wiki!The distributed notary is the core component of the Atmosphere.The design idea of Atmosphere is realized by the side chain and Two-way Peg methodologies. Spectrum is used as a main chain, and other public chains are used as the side chain.Of course, you can also change the roles of both parties. The side chain assets are mapped to Spectrum through two-way Peg. With the intermediary role of Spectrum, the user can further realize cross-chain asset swap, cross-chain payment, cross-chain data paid access and other functions. Atmosphere solution uses distributed key, HTLC atomic interchange, threshold signature, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, PBFT and other technologies to build a secure and stable cross-chain process.
